`[Note]` After running `tf_vit.ipynb` or `keras_vit.ipynb`, which may consume almost 100% of GPU memory and doesn't seem to release it, make sure to: (1) `Shut Down All Kernels...` and (2) `Restart Kernel...` to clear the GPU memory. Otherwise, you might encounter "out of memory (OOM)" related errors when subsequently running other code. That's my temporary workaround that I came up with to avoid memory issues when running the Tensorflow and Keras ViT implemetations.
