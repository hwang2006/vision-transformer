`[Note]` After running the `tf_vit.ipynb` or `keras_vit.ipynb` that seemed to take up almost 100% GPU memory, you need to make sure to do (1) `Shut Down All Kernels...` and (2) `Restart Kernel...` to flush GPU memory. Otherwise, you might be facing `out of memory` relating errors when running the other codes.
